Manuscript:**“Evolutionary dynamics and molecular adaptation of Rift Valley fever virus across human and non-human outbreaks in Africa (1940-2020)”**

This repository contains reproducible scripts, workflows, and outputs used to generate all protein coding mutations across L,M,S segments, phylogenetic tree reconstruction, selection pressure analyses and all R/Python scripts used in the study

#### Project Overview

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen with a broad host range and significant public health and veterinary impact across Africa. This study performed the first continental wide analysis integrating:

- Identification of Protein coding mutations  
- Comparative genomic diversity (Human,livestock, wildlife & vectors) 
- Time-scaled phylogenetics to study transmission bottlenecks
- Ancestral state reconstruction  
- Codon level selection pressure analysis using models 
- Spatiotemporal distribution of adaptive mutations
---
#### Results

The analyses identify seven nonsynonymous mutations, adaptive codons and host-specific selection signals that shape RVFV evolution across Africa (1940-2020)
