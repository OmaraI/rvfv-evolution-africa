Analysis workflow and supporting code for the manuscript:

**“Evolutionary Dynamics and Molecular Adaptation of Rift Valley Fever Virus Across Human and Non-human Outbreaks in Africa.”**

This repository contains reproducible scripts, workflows, and datasets used to generate all mutation profiling, phylogenetic trees, temporal reconstructions, and selection pressure analyses for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) genomes (1940–2020).

#### 📌 Project Overview

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus with a broad host range and significant public health and veterinary impact across Africa. This project performs the first continental-scale analysis integrating:

- Protein-coding mutation identification  
- Cross-host comparative genomic diversity  
- Time-scaled phylogenetics  
- Codon-level selection pressure analysis using models (FUBAR, FEL, SLAC)  
- Geographic and temporal mapping of adaptive mutations  

The analyses identify seven nonsynonymous mutations, adaptive codons and host-specific selection signals that shape RVFV evolution across Africa (1940-2020)
